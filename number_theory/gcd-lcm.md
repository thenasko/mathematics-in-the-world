## GCD and LCM

GCD is an abbreviation for *greatest common divisor*, and LCM for *least common multiple*. When no confusion can arise, we will denote these functions by
$$
(a,b) = \gcd(a,b), \qquad
[a,b] = \lcm(a,b).
$$
The following properties are worth noting:
* $$(a,b) = (b,a)$, $[a,b] = [b,a]$$,
* $$[a,b] = a b / (a,b)$$,
* $$(a,b) = (-a, b)$$,
* $$(a,b) = (a, b \pm a)$$.
If $$(a,b) = 1$$, we call $$a$$ and $$b$$ *coprime*.


### Finding coprimes

> Let $$n$$ be a positive integer. If $$S \subset \{1, \dots, 2n\}$$ is a set of size $$n+1$$, show that there exist two distinct coprime elements $$a, b \in S$$.

> Find the greatest common divisor of $$F_{2014}$$ and $$F_{2015}$$.
