## Polynomials

### Where is the monomino?
    
> * Imagine we tile a $$4 \times 4$$ board with five $$3 \times 1$$ pieces and a single $$1 \times 1$$ piece, a monomino. What are the possible monomino positions?
> * What are the possible monomino positions if we tile a $$5 \times 5$$ board with eight $$3 \times 1$$ pieces and a monomino?

### Two dice

> The possible sums of two standard dice (with numbers $$1, \dots, 6$$ on their faces) are $$2, 3, \dots, 12$$ which occur with frequencies
> $$
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
$$
> Do there exist two non-standard dice with positive integers on their faces such that the sum of the two has the same frequencies as above?
> 
> (Hint: If this sounds complicated, try starting with tetrahedral dice first.)
