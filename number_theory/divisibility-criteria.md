## Divisibility criteria

A *divisibility criterion* for a number $$n$$ is a rule which quickly allows us to check if a number is divisible by $$n$$. Of course, one can always divide into $$n$$ and verify that that there is no remainder, but that is a very tedious operation.

We are looking for something much quicker, a condition one can almost check in a single glance. Usually these tricks are expressed in terms of the digits in decimal expansion. For example, a number is divisible by 10 if it ends in a 0 (in its decimal expansion).
