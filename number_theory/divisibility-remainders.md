## Divisibility and remainders

### Square plus one

> Can you find a positive integer $$d$$ which divides both $$n^2 + 1$$ and $$(n+1)^2 + 1$$ for some $$n \in \mathbb{Z}$$? How many such $$d$$ are there?


### Integers?

> Why are the fractions
> $$
> \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
> \qquad\textrm{and}\qquad
> \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
> $$
> integers (for $$n \in \mathbb{Z}$$)? Try to find an argument which doesn't appeal to the summation identities.
