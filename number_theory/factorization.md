## Prime factorization

### Trailing zeroes

> How many zeroes does $$100!$$ end in?

The number of zeroes at the end of a number $$n$$ is given by the highest power of 10 that divides the number. Moreover, considering the highest power of 2 and the highest power of 5 dividing $$n$$, this number is going to be the smallest of the two. For example, the number $$2^4\cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^7$$ ends with 4 zeroes (in fact, this number is $$11250000$$).

### A fixed number of divisors

> What is the smallest natural number which has exactly 77 divisors?


### The locker game

> The students of a local high school enjoy the following extra-curricular activity. After the end of the day, all 100 students go in front of their closed lockers, numbered 1 to 100. The headmaster then proceeds to blow a whistle 100 times. At the first sound, all students open their lockers. At the second, the students standing by even lockers close them. The game continues in a similar manner -- at the $$n$$-th step students in front of lockers divisible by $$n$$ toggle them.
