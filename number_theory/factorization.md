## Prime factorization

### Trailing zeroes

> How many zeroes does $$100!$$ end in?

The number of zeroes at the end of a number $$n$$ is given by the highest power of 10 that divides the number. Moreover, considering the highest power of 2 and the highest power of 5 dividing $$n$$, this number is going to be the smallest of the two. For example, the number $$2^4\cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^7$$ ends with 4 zeroes (in fact, this number is $$11250000$$).

### A fixed number of divisors

> What is the smallest natural number which has exactly 77 divisors?
