## The Fibonacci sequence

### Tiling a strip

In how many ways can you tile an $$n \times 2$$ strip with dominoes?


### Sum of Fibonacci squares

Find a geometric proof of the identity
$$
F_1^2 + \cdots + F_n^2 = F_n F_{n+1}.
$$


### The negative Fibonacci sequence

Manipulating the recursive relation
$$
F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n
$$
to
$$
F_n = F_{n+2} - F_{n+1},
$$
allows us to define the Fibonacci numbers $$F_n$$ for negative values of $$n$$. Can you express $$F_{-n}$$ in terms of $$F_n$$?


### The Fibonacci limit

What is the limit
$$
\lim_{n \rarr F_n} \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}?
$$


### The Fibonacci numbers and linear algebra

Find a $$2 \times 2$$ matrix $$A$$ such that
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
  F_{n+2} \\
  F_{n+1}
\end{pmatrix}
=
A
\begin{pmatrix}
  F_{n+1} \\
  F_n
\end{pmatrix}.
$$
Use this to find a closed formula for $$F_n$$ in terms of $$n$$.


### The Fibonacci numbers and power series

Define the function $f(x)$ in terms of the infinite power series
$$
f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty F_n x^n.
$$
What does the recursive relation satisfied by $$F_n$$ say about $$f(x)$$? Does this give an alternative derivation of the closed formula for $$F_n$$?
