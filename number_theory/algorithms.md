## Algorithms in number theory

### Primality checking

> How can you check that a number $n$ is prime? What is the fastest algorithm you can find?


### Sieve of Eratosthenes

> Given a number $n$, how can you find all prime numbers $p \leq n$?


### Euclid's algorithms

> Given two numbers $a$ and $b$, how can you compute their greatest common divisor $(a, b)$ fast?
