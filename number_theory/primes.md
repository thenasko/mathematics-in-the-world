## Prime numbers

### One less than a perfect square

> Find a prime number which is one less than a perfect square. How many can you find?

In this problems, it is very important to make the statement into an equation. In our case, it becomes

$$p=n^2-1,$$

where $$n$$ is an integer and $$p$$ is a prime number. Next step, is an algebraic manipulation of the equation, and we get

$$p=(n+1)(n-1).$$

We can now use the information that we have, that $$p$$ is a prime number. The property that we are going to use is that whenever a prime number is a product of two integers, then one of the two is 1. In our case, this means that either $$n+1$$ or $$n-1$$ is 1! Hence, that $$n$$ is either 0 or 2. In case $$n$$ is 0, looking again at the equation, then $$p$$ would be -1, that is not a prime number.
