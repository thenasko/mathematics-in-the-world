## Generating functions

### The Fibonacci numbers and power series

> Define the function $$f(x)$$ in terms of the infinite power series
> $$
> f(x) = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty F_n x^n.
> $$
> What does the recursive relation satisfied by $$F_n$$ say about $$f(x)$$? Does this give an alternative derivation of the closed formula for $$F_n$$?


### Using generating functions

> Use generating functions to find a closed formula for each of the following sequences:
> * $$a_0 = 0,\; a_{n+1} = 2 a_n + 1$$,
> * $$b_0 = 0,\; b_{n+1} = 2 b_n + n$$.
