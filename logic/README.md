# Logic

### Racing horses

> Imagine we have 25 horses and a track with 5 lanes. What is the minimum number of races necessary to find the top three horses?
> 
> You can assume all horses perform consistently (e.g., they run at a constant speed which does not vary between races).


### Infinite exponentiation

> If
> $$
> x^{x^{x^\cdots}} = 2,
> $$
> what is the value of $$x$$?


### Renaissance security

> Leodardo da Vinci would like to send a private message to his close friend Niccol\`o Macchiavelli. The messenger they use can deliver a box from one location to the other. Unfortunately, the service is not secure so anything they place in an unlocked box will be seen, copied, or worse, lost. How can they exchange the message securely?

In this problem it is very important to start with the right idea. In this case, we are referring to the fact that the package can go back and forth involving multiple shipments.

The first step is Leonardo sending a box containing the message secured by his own lock (that is, a lock only he can unlock). Then, Machiavelli just adds his lock to the box, and sends it back to Leonardo. Leonardo removes his lock from the box and sends it back to Machiavelli. Finally, Machiavelli receives the box secured only by how lock. Removing it gives him access to the secret message.

### The average offer

> A number of Harvard seniors plan to meet and celebrate their job offers. Being naturally curious, they would like to know the average salary in the group. On the other hand, no single student would like to disclose his offer to anyone else. How can they learn the group average?
