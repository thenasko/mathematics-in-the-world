### The boss's birthday

> Alice, a manager at Big-Name-Firm Inc, thought of a riddle to give her colleagues Bryan and Claire. She told them that her birthday is on one of the following dates.
> 
>     March 4, March 5, March 8
> 
>     June 4, June 7
> 
>     September 1, September 5
> 
>     December 1, December 2, December 8

> Alice also told the Bryan the month of her birthday, and Claire the day. Later on, the following conversation took place.

>     Bryan: I don't know Alice's Birthday, but you don't know it either.
> 
>     Claire: I didn't know her birthday initially, but now I do.
> 
>     Bryan: Now I know it too.

> What is Alice's birthday?

The answer is September 1. Before everyone speaks, Claire can know the birthday only if the birthday is June 7 or December 2, because the dates 2 and 7 are unique. Bryan knows this fact, and he additionallyknows that Claire doesn't know the birthday, given his knowledge of the month. So the month that Bryan knows is either March or September. (Otherwise Bryan cannot speak with certainty that Claire doesn't know.) Claire can carry out the same analysis above and know that the month is now restricted to March and September. This knowledge equips her to know the birthday. Therefore, the date has to initially not be unique, but become unique after restricting to March and September. When Bryan carries out the above analysis, he knows that the birthday cannot be March 5 or September 5 (because the date is still not unique). When he eliminates the two dates, he has March 4, March 8 and September 1 remaining. Since Bryan knowing the month now allows him to deduce Alice's birthday, the birthday is September 1.
