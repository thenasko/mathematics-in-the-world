## Miscellaneous

### Melting ice

> Several ice formations can be seen in the nearby mountains. Your map is a rectangular grid in which squares containing ice are marked with Xs. As it happens every spring, the ice starts to melt. During any day, the ice in a square will melt if and only if at least one of the four surrounding squares does not contain ice.
> 
> You have found a second map which indicates the location of an ancient treasure is buried under the ice. How can you compute the number of days you need to wait before starting to dig for the treasure?
