### Exchange

> How can you switch the values of two (integer) variables without using an auxiliary third one?


### Finding the non-duplicate

> You are given an array of integers all of which repeat twice with the exception of one. Can you find the value of that element using linear time and constant memory?


### Power of 2

> How can you check whether a positive integer is a power of 2 without using loops or the logarithm function?


### Counting ones

> Given an integer, count the number of ones in its binary presentation.
