## Hashing

### Finding summands

> Given an array $$A$$ and an integer $$n$$, find elements $$a$$ and $$b$$ of $$A$$ such that $$a + b = n$$.


### Unique elements

> Given a list of integers, remove all duplicates from it.


### Word frequency

> Given an body of text, construct a list of all words that appear in it together with their frequencies.


### Finding anagrams

> Two words are called *anagrams( if one can be obtained from the other by rearranging its letters. For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams. Given a dictionary of words, split it into groups such that each consists of words that are anagrams of each other.
