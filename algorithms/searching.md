## Searching

### Minimum and maximum

> How many comparisons do you need to find the minimum of an array of length $$n$$? What about the maximum? What if you need both?


### Binary search

> You are given an array and asked to check if a given element appears in it. What is the time complexity of your solution? How would you answer change if the input array is sorted?


### Intersecting sorted arrays

> You are given two sorted arrays $$A$$ and $$B$$ and asked to compute their intersection $$C$$, an array containing all elements that appear in both $$A$$ and $$B$$ and if free of duplicates. Let $$a$$ and $$b$$ be the lengths of $$A$$ and $$B$$ respectively. What is a good way to find $$C$$ if $$a \approx b$$? What if $$a \ll b$$ or $$a \gg b$$?


### Sorted matrix search

> We call a matrix *sorted* if each of its rows and columns is sorted. What is the fastest way to check if a sorted matrix contains a given value?
