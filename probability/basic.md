## Basic probability

### Successive wins

> You signed up for a tennis tournament in which you win a prize if you win (at least) two successive games in a row of three. Your two opponents are your friend and the club champion. Given the option to play friend-champion-friend or champion-friend-champion, which scenario would you pick? What is the expected number of wins in each case?


### Flippant juror

> As part of his jury duty, an undergraduate student was chosen to participate in a jury of three members (majority rules). To express his disinterest in the case, he decides to vote by flipping a fair coin. The other two members of the jury independently will make the right decision with probability $p$. How does this arrangement compare to a single member jury which decides on the correct outcome with the same probability $p$?


### First six

> How many times do you need to throw a die on average before you get a $6$?


### Perfect hand

> In a game of bridge, what is the probability that you are dealt a perfect hand (13 cards of one color)?


### Walking in Manhattan

> Imagine a city whose streets form a perfect grid. Starting at the point with coordinates $$(0,0)$$, how many ways are there to walk to the intersection $$(m, n)$$ in $$m + n$$ steps?


### A personal taste for money

> Ten white and ten black balls are placed in an urn. You are allowed to choose one of the two colors. A ball is drawn from the urn, and it the color matches you get $\$10$. If the colors are not a match, there is no prize. If the game is to be played only once, how much are you willing to pay for it?


### St.~Petersburg paradox

> A casino offers a game in which a fair coin is tossed at east stage. The initial steak is $\$2$. If the coin comes up tails, you receive the steak. If we get heads, the steak is doubled, and the process repeats. How much should they charge for this game?
> 
> What if every time we get heads, the steak is increased by one? How much should they charge?
