## Random walks

### Falling over a fence

> A drunk man has found his way to a fence. One step forward, and he will hit the fence and fall over. The man takes random steps towards or away from the fence. The probability of taking a step forward is 1/3, and for a step backward it is 2/3.

> (a) What is the probability to escape the fence and stay up?
>
> (b) What is the answer if the probability of a step backward is $$p \in (0,1)$$?
>
> (c) More generally, what is the answer if the drunk man starts $$k \geq 1$$ steps from the fence?


### Gambler's ruin

> You have $$a$$ dollars in your pocket, and your friend has $$b$$ in his. You agree to play the following game. At each step you flip a fair coin. If it comes up heads you friend gives you 1 dollar, and otherwise you give him 1. The process continues until one of you exhausts their resources, and the winner takes the lump sum of $$a + b$$ dollars. What is the probability of winning? What is the probability of winning if the coin comes up heads with probability $$p \in (0,1)$$?
