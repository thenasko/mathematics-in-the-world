# Probability

Everyone knows something about probability, even if they don't realize it! By virtue of living in a physical world, we all acquire some intuition about probabilistic phenomena. There are times when our intuition is correct, but there are even more examples when our intuition is misguided. The study of mathematical probability is particularly exciting because it allows us to adjust and strengthten this inner sense of understanding.
