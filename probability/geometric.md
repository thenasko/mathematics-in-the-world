## Geometric probability

### Coin in square

> The following game is often offered at carnivals. There is a table whose surface is ruled in 1-inch squares. You take a penny from your pocket (3/4 inch diameter), and after stepping several feet away from the table, you throw the penny on top of it. If the penny falls within a single square, you get 5 cents and your penny back. If the penny falls on one of the rulings, you loose your penny. Would you play this game?


### Serendipity

> After talking about the iconic movies "Serendipity" and "Sleepless in Seattle" on a dating website, a potential couple decides to go on a random date. Each party will show up at a predetermined restaurant randomly between 7 and 8 pm, and wait for exactly 15 minutes, but no later than 8 pm. If they run into each other, the relationship was meant to be, and otherwise, they move on. What is the chance of success?


### Random chord

> If we select a chord randomly on a fixed circle, what is the probability that its length will exceed the radius of the circle?


### Points in a semicircle

> If we choose $$n$$ points randomly on a fixed circle, what is the probability they will lie in a semicircle?


### Landing on the side

> How thick should a coin be so that it lands with probability 1/3 on its side?

### Upright table

> A carpenter with a good sense of humor attached three legs to a circular table-top in random uniformly distributed positions. What is the chance the table will stay upright?


### Estimating $$\pi$$

> Find a way to estimate $\pi$ using an apparatus which generates random uniformly distributed numbers in the unit interval.

### Point on a segment

> The unit interval is cut in two using a randomly chosen point. What is the expected length of the shorter piece? What about the longer one?


### Two points on a segment

> The unit interval is cut at two two independently chosen random points. What is the expected length of the left piece?


### Simplex

> Suppose that $$X_1, \dots, X_n$$ are independent random variables with the uniform distribution on $$[0,1]$$. What is the probability that $$X_1 + \cdots + X_n \leq 1$$?
